Hi! Sharan here. As an assignment for my Virtual Reality and Game Design class, I had to create a video game that could run on the VR headset. 
I chose to recreate the popular online game "Run" by using Unity to develop the User Interface and the all of the objects in the game,
and I used Visual Studio to create scripts to attach to the objects in the game to give them functionality. The scripts were coded using the C# language.
